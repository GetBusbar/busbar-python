"""Fail if README.md's version claims have drifted from what this repo ships.

The README states two numbers by hand: the SDK's own semver and the busbar
OpenAPI `info.version` it was generated against. Both went stale silently once
already (the README claimed SDK `0.2.0` against spec `1.5.0` while the repo was
shipping `0.4.0` against `1.5.3`), because nothing checked them. This does.

Sources of truth:
  SDK version  -> setup.py's `version="..."` (itself generated from
                  openapi-python-client.yaml's package_version_override)
  spec version -> openapi.json's info.version

Two checks:
  1. The two marker bullets in README.md must name exactly those values.
  2. Outside the `### History` section (where old version numbers are the
     point), no busbar-shaped `1.x.y` token may disagree with the spec version.
     Put `version-check: ignore` on a line to exempt it.
